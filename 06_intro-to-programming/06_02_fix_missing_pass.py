# The code below runs into an error.
# Fix it, without making Python do anything.

flag = False
while flag:
    #keep doing what you're doing
    pass
print("all done.")

#to fix error, double indent line 8
#looks Like:
#flag = False
#while flag:
    # keep doing what you're doing

    #print("all done.")

# place "pass" keyword on line 8 in front of "print..."?
