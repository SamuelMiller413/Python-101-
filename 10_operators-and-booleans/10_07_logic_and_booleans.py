# Demonstrate the use of all logical operators (and, or, not) below.
# Create variables that hold boolean values, then combine them

#   do two wrongs make a right?

# Note that the truth value of the statement doesn't matter,
# but try to use all three logical operators in one line of code
# to get another boolean value as your result :)

# Hey Michael! I'm not sure what the instructions are prompting me to do.
# Particularly, I'm unclear what they mean by 'expressing' the sentence:
#       'do two wrongs make a right?'
# should the sentence be coded with the operators? If so, how would I include them?

# lines 21:30 are my attempt. I've had a ton of fun coding it,
# but I suspect I'm misinterpreting the assignment. 
# Any help would be greaT!
